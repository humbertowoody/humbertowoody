### Hello GitHubers! ðŸ––

My name is Humberto. I am a 23-year-old software developer working on [@fetchbug](github.com/fetchbug) to build data APIs and webservices in my home country MÃ©xico getting people closer to the data around them.

I love (and work with):

- C/C++
- TypeScript _and_ JavaScript
- DevOps
- Python

My future-self, should totally know about (because I'm currently learning):

- Rust
- IaC

#### Let's chat!

I am an ever-learning, ever-changing, ever-growing person with a love for taquitos, pizza, doughnuts and jokes. If you'd like to talk to me about **anything**, literally, please contact me using your favorite medium:

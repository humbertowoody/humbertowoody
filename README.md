### Hello GitHub-_ers_! ðŸ––

My name is Humberto. I am a 23-year-old software developer working on [@fetchbug](https://github.com/fetchbug) building data APIs and products in my home country: MÃ©xico, with the goal of getting people closer to the information around them.

I love (and work with):

- TypeScript _and_ JavaScript
- C/C++
- DevOps Wizardry
- Python

My future-self, should totally know about (because I'm currently learning):

- Rust
- Lisp
- IaC Tooling
- Elixir

#### Hobby lobby

In my free time, I play with IoT, improve my homelab, write in [humbertowoody.xyz](https://humbertowoody.xyz), fantasize about _yet another_ mechanical keyboard, and learn about other technological areas (there is so much to learn!); for some years I worked mostly on networking and general SysAdmin roles, sometimes I still play around with the _internet thingys_ around me in hopes of learning some of 'em _hacker skillz_, you know, at least one. Once I attended every meetup, hackathon and event in exchange of swag and food (you can picture me as a _meetup-junkie_ in rehab, at least during pandemic's terms), now I just write code and solve problems.

I am a roller coaster, theme park, mechanical and structural engineering enthusiast, aspirational comedian and long-time script-kiddie.

#### Let's chat!

I am an ever-learning, ever-changing, ever-growing person with a love for taquitos, pizza, doughnuts and jokes. If you'd like to talk to me about **anything**, literally, please contact me using your favorite medium:

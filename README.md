# Hello! :wave:

My name is Humberto. I am a software developer working on [@fetchbug][fetchbug-website]
building data APIs and products in MÃ©xico. I specialize in TypeScript,
JavaScript, C/C++, DevOps, and Python, and I am constantly expanding my
skillset in areas such as Rust, Lisp, IaC Tooling, and Elixir. I'm also a
DevOps engineer at [@Pago46][pago46-website].

In my free time, I enjoy playing with IoT, improving my homelab, and [writing][humbertowoody-website].
